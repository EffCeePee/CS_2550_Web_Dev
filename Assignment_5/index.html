<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>For this course I will be creating code for the minesweeper game.  
This will be a web based application written using code from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>


<h3>How to play</h3>
<p>Minesweeper is a game where the player searches for bombs in a grid and marks them with flags.
  If the player clicks on a square with a bomb then the game is over.  
  The player wins the game by identifying all of the bombs in grid without clicking on a bomb square and setting it off.
  A player can identify the bombs by right clicking and placing a flag in the square.  
  This will prevent the player from accidentally setting the bomb off.</p>
