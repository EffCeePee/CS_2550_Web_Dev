<h1>Project Design </h1>
<p>
This page is dedicated to laying out the preliminary design of the project.
This is not intended to be a final design but an initial idea on how the game will be laid out and played.


<h3><u>Constants:</u> (in JavaScript these are just unchanging variables)</h3>

<strong>BEGINNER_SIZE:</strong>  The size of the grid for a beginner game. <br>
<strong>INTERMEDIATE_SIZE:</strong>  The size of the grid for an intermediate game.<br>
<strong>ADVANCED_SIZE:</strong> The size of an advanced game.<br>
<strong>BEGINNER_BOMB_COUNT:</strong> The maximum number of bombs for a beginner game.<br>
<strong>INTERMEDIATE_BOMB_COUNT:</strong> The maximum number of bombs for a intermediate game.<br>
<strong>ADVANCED_BOMB_COUNT:</strong> The maximum number of bombs for a advanced game.<br>

<h3><u>Objects:</u></h3>

<strong>Square</strong> 
<br>A square will have a <strong>_bomb,</strong>  <strong>_adjacentBombs</strong>  and a <strong>_flaged</strong> property.<br>

<ul>
<li> <strong>_bomb</strong>: boolean property to determine if it holds a or not.  </li>
<li> <strong>_adjacentBombs</strong>: if there is not a bomb  it will hold the number of adjacent bombs</li>
<li> <strong>_flagged</strong>: tells if the sqare has been marked by a flag </li>
</ul>

<br> Square object example: <br>
{"_bomb": true, "_adjacentBombs" : null, "flagged": true}<br>
{"_bomb": false, "_adjacentBombs" : 2, "flagged": false}<br>
{"_bomb": false, "_adjacentBombs" : 0, "flagged": false}<br>
<br>
<hr>
<strong>Game</strong>
<br> A Game will have a _bombCount property. <br>

<ul>
<li> <strong> _bombCount </strong>: This will count the number of bombs flagged. <br>

</ul>

<br> Game object example: <br>
{"_bombCount" :  20} <br>

<br>
<hr>
<strong>Difficulty</strong>
The Difficulty object will have <strong> _beginner, _intermdiate_,</strong> and <strong>_advanced </strong> properties.

<ul>
<li><strong>_beginner</strong>: a boolean value that will be used when calling the difficulty function
when the game is being set up.</li>
<li><strong>_intermdiate_</strong>: a boolean value that will be used when calling the difficulty function
when the game is being set up.</li>
<li><strong>_advanced</strong>: a boolean value that will be used when calling the difficulty function
when the game is being set up.</li>
</ul>


<br>
<hr>
<strong>Clock</strong>

<br>


<h3><u>Functions:</u></h3>

<I>Random(_size)</I>: this function will be to set up the status of each square in the game. 
It will take a size variable and randomly set the squares that will get bombs
<br>
<br>
<I>ClockCount()</I>: this function will be a counter that tells how much time it has taken to complete the game.
<br><br>
<I>BombCount(_bombCount)</I>: this function will show how many bombs have not been flagged.
<br><br>
<I>CountAdjacent()</I>: This function will see how many bombs are in the adjacent squares.
<br><br>

<h3><u>Notes:</u></h3>
<ol>
<li>This is a preliminary design and does not list all of the variables that will be used.  </li>
<li>There will also be other objects added or removed at a later time </li>
<li>There will be more functions added later </li>
<li>This does not explain any of the graphical or visual layouts </li>
</ol>
