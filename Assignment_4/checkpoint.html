        <h1>Checkpoint</h1>
        <p>
            The minesweeper game that I have chosen has gone along well with the assignments given.  Obviously, I won't know all of the details of the functions that I will write to complete the game but I'm going to give a list of functions and how much of those are completed.
        </p>
        <h2>Function List and Progress</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a game grid: 100% complete</li>
            <li>Creating ability to select game difficulty: 100% complete</li>
            <li>Creating the abiltiy to click on squares and show bomb, flag, or number:  60% complete. <ul><li>The remaining 40% is actually creating the flag logic. The main part is the hardest and is done. </li></ul> </li> 
            <li>Creating a clock counter: 0% complete <ul><li>With the completion of this assingment I now have the knowelge needed.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Creating a bomb counter element: 0% complete</li>
            <li>Creating a winner annimation: 0% complete</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> Overall, I feel like I'm progressing well with this project.  I feel that I'm well beyond the 25% done that you are looking for.  I'm not sure yet about the XML / JSON elements that we will need to implement but I'm confident that I can do it.</p>
